# THE SHARK ATTACK ANALYSIS


The shark attack analysis is not a real analysis. We will work our way through a massive amount of data, we will find out things about those marvellous animals and their playful attacks, but mostly, The shark attack is a game of endurance against data in a land of data frame madness.

We will face the information retrieved from the global shark attacks data frame trying to clean the inputs the best we can in order to gain some insight into the world of shark encounters in the world and we will find out in the process, not only, which are the deadliest sharks in the world, the time of the day they are more active or even the region of the world were you are more incline to be attacked, but the importance of having a well maintained database, because the real conclusion to this study is not when to get into the ocean for a quick swim or not, do not fool our good selves, the real conclusion here is that if the data inputs are not standardized, organized and properly arranged, the work and life of the data analyst or data ingeneer could become an absolute madness.

So in reality, the shark attack analysis is a work of cleaning, a work of sorting things out and putting thoughts together to achieve a standardized data frame with which you can start to get some real insight. And to achieve that we will use all the resources in our hands, we will use pandas methods and functions to clean those values, to find the keys that would allow us to find the common sense of what we are working with, we will use regex to find specifics and we will feed our own inputs to the data frame to replace madness with sense.

It has been a journey, and even though sometimes it has been as challenging as the most difficult of tasks, this has probably been the best opportunity that I've had to use the knowledge and skills that I am getting in the process of becoming a data analyst.
